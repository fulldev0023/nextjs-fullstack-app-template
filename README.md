## Project Setup

We'll begin by creating a default NextJs application with a Typescript template.

```bash
npx create-next-app --ts nextjs-fullstack-app-template

cd nextjs-fullstack-app-template
```

First we will test to make sure the app is working. We're going to be using `yarn` for this example, but you could just as easily use NPM if you choose.

```
yarn install

yarn dev
```

You should see the demo app available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Engine Locking

We would like for all developers working on this project to use the same Node engine and package manager we are using. TO do that we create two new files:

- `.nvmrc` -- Will tell other uses of the project which version of Node is used
- `.npmrc` - WIll tell other users of the project which package manager is used

We are using `Node v16 Gallium` and `yarn` for this project so we set those values like so:

`.nvmrc`

```.nvmrc
lts/gallium
```

`.npmrc`

```
engine-strict=true
```

You can check your version of Node with `node --version` and make sure you are setting the correct one. A list of Node version codenames can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/blob/main/CODENAMES.md)

Note that the use of `engine-strict` didn't specifically say anything about `yarn`, we do that in `package.json`:

`package.json`

```json
  "name": "nextjs-fullstack-app-template",
  "author": "Alex Eagleson",
  "description": "A tutorial and template for creating a production-ready fullstack NextJs application",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "license" : "MIT"
  "homepage": "https://github.com/alexeagleson/nextjs-fullstack-app-template"
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=16.0.0",
    "yarn": ">=1.22.0",
    "npm": "please-use-yarn"
  },
  ...
```

The `engines` field is where you specify the specific versions of the tools you are using. You can also fill in your personal details if you choose.

## First Commit

This would be a good time to make our first commit to our remote repo, to make sure our changes are backed up, and to follow best practices for keeping related changes grouped within a single commit before moving to something new.

By default your NextJs project will already have a repo initialized. You can check what branch you are on with `git status`. It should say something like:

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .npmrc
        .nvmrc
```

This tells us we are on the `main` branch and we have not staged or made any commits yet.

Let's commit our changes so far.

```
git add .

git commit -m 'project initialization'
```

The first command will add and stage all files in your project directory that aren't ignored in `.gitignore`. The second will make a commit of the state of your current project with the message we wrote after the `-m` flag.

Hop over to your preferred git hosting provider ([Github](https://github.com) for example) and create a new repository to host this project. Make sure the default branch is se tto the same name as the branch on your local machine to avoid any confusion.

On Github you can change yur global default branch name to whatever you like by going to:

```
Settings -> Repositories -> Repository default branch
```

Now you are ready to add the remote origin of your repository and push. Github will give you the exact instructions when you create it. Your syntax may be a little different than mine depending on if you are using HTTPS rather than SSH.

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/{YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME}.git

git push -u origin {YOUR_BRANCH_NAME}
```

## Code Formatting and Quality Tools

In order to set a standard that will be used by all contributors to the project to keep the code style consistent and basic best practices followed we will be implementing two tools:

- [eslint](https://eslint.org/) - For best practices on coding standards
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) - For automatic formatting of code files

We'll begin with ESLint, which is easy because it automatically comes installed and pre-configured with NextJs projects.

We are just going to add a little bit of extra configuration and make it a bit stricter than it is by default. If you disagree with any of the rules it sets, no need to worry, it's very easy to disable any of them manually. We configure everything in `.eslintrc.json` which should already exist in your root directory:

`.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "extends": ["next", "next/core-web-vitals", "eslint:recommended"],
  "globals": {
    "React": "readonly"
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": [1, { "args": "after-used", "argsIgnorePattern": "^_" }]
  }
}
```
